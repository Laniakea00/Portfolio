Laniakea Portfolio
Welcome to the Laniakea Portfolio! This project represents my personal portfolio as an 18-year-old student at Astana IT University, featuring key sections about me, my interests, and my future goals.

Project Overview
This portfolio site is designed to showcase my projects, interests, and contact information. It includes several interactive elements, such as a background color changer, real-time clock display, and a login system, providing a personalized experience for users.
